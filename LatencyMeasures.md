# Latency Measures

## Bluetooth

Filmed on an iphone and isolated the frame at which blowing begins and frame at which a 1 appears on the OSC client in a terminal window.

Found ~20-30ms attributed to this.



## OSC

Latency here seems a little slower/less consistent. We did this over a mobile hotspot -- perhaps dedicated WiFi will prove faster.

Saw range of values.
